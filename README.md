# The Impact of Diabetes Percentage and Human Development Index (HDI) on COVID-19 Death Cases in 2020: A Study on Global Trends


## Introduction and Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread devastation across the globe, leading to significant loss of life and economic damage. While the virus affects people of all ages, it has been observed that people with preexisting health conditions such as diabetes are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms and complications. Additionally, the Human Development Index (HDI) of a country plays a major role in determining its ability to prevent, diagnose, and treat COVID-19 cases. Therefore, understanding the relationship between diabetes percentage, HDI, and COVID-19 death cases is crucial in devising effective strategies to combat the pandemic.

In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis by applying OLS regression analysis to determine if countries with a high percentage of diabetes patients have a higher COVID-19 death count and if the same is true for countries with a low HDI rating. By analyzing the interaction variable (diabetes percentage*HDI), this study sheds light on the complex relationship between diabetes, HDI, and COVID-19 death cases, which can guide us in implementing targeted interventions to reduce COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality.

The data utilized in this study was extracted from the [COVID-19 Open Data Repository](https://health.google.com/covid-19/open-data/raw-data) and the [WHO COVID-19 Dashboard](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/coronavirus-covid-19-cases-and-deaths).
